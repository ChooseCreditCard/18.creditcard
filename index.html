          Turning 18 often means new financial freedom – including the option to apply for a first credit card.
          This page explains what that step actually involves, in neutral, educational language.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>First Card: Tool, Not Free Money</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card at 18 is essentially a short-term loan with a flexible limit. You are allowed to spend
        up to that limit and then decide how quickly to repay. Used carefully, it can help build a credit
        history and make online payments easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, every transaction is still borrowed money until you pay it back. Interest, fees and late
        payments can have long-term effects that go far beyond the first purchase. Understanding this
        difference between “having money” and “having access to credit” is the key starting point.
      </p>

    <!-- Eligibility & checks -->
    <section id="eligibility" class="section">
      <h2>Typical Eligibility Checks Around Age 18</h2>
      <p>
        Exact rules differ by country and bank, but many issuers consider similar factors when an 18-year-old
        applies for a card:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Age and legal capacity:</strong>
          you usually need to be a legal adult and able to enter into a contract in your jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identity and address:</strong>
          proof of who you are and where you live is normally mandatory for anti-fraud and regulatory reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Income and stability:</strong>
          some issuers ask for proof of income, employment or other resources to judge whether you can handle repayments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Credit history (if any):</strong>
          at 18 there may be little or no previous record, which can mean smaller limits or starter products.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some systems, young adults start with student or “first card” products that are deliberately simpler,
        with modest limits and clearer guardrails. Others may become authorised users on a parent’s account instead.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Habits & risks -->
    <section id="habits" class="section">
      <h2>Habits That Matter More Than the Limit</h2>
      <p>
        For a first card, the most important decisions are not the colour of the plastic or the headline reward rate,
        but the habits you build in the first months:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Paying on time:</strong> avoiding late fees and protecting your early payment record.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aim to pay in full:</strong> paying the full statement balance helps avoid interest altogether.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keeping utilisation modest:</strong> using only a portion of your limit is often highlighted as a
          positive signal in many credit-education resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading statements:</strong> checking charges, fees and interest so you understand the real cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        18.Creditcard does not give personal financial advice or recommend specific products. The goal is to explain
        structures so you can read issuer documentation and independent guides with more confidence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Pitfalls -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Pitfalls for First-Time Cardholders</h2>
      <p>Educational resources about young adults and credit cards often warn about patterns like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using cards to cover regular expenses without a plan to repay.</li>
        <li>Ignoring minimum payments or due dates until late fees appear.</li>
        <li>Letting small purchases build into a balance that feels “too big to clear”.</li>
        <li>Applying for multiple cards quickly without understanding the impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Learning about interest, credit scores and repayment before applying can reduce the risk of these problems.
        Many universities, consumer agencies and banks publish neutral educational material on these topics.
